## QuickStatements 3.0 public documentation : Home page features

The homepage of the QST3 site provides several key features for users to interact with QuickStatements. Below is a detailed explanation of the available options and links:

### 1. New Batch
**Functionality:** This option redirects you to a page where you can submit a new batch command.
How it works: By clicking this link, you are taken to a form where you can input the necessary information and parameters for your batch command. Once the form is filled out, you can execute your batch directly from this page.

### 2. Last Batches
**Functionality:** This is a placeholder link (hashtag link) that currently does not redirect to any page or provide any functionality.
>[!Note]: It might be planned for future development, but at the moment, clicking this link does not perform any action.

### 3. Git
**Functionality:** Links to the Git repository of QuickStatements version 3 (V3) on GitHub.
Purpose: This provides direct access to the main codebase of QuickStatements for users who want to explore the source code, contribute, or report issues.

### 4. Login
**Functionality:** Another placeholder link (hashtag link) that does not currently redirect to any page or perform any function.
Note: This might be reserved for future implementation, such as user authentication or login features.

### 5. See Batch Details
**Functionality:** Allows you to search for and view batch details by entering a specific batch ID.
How it works: When you input a batch ID into the provided search field, the system will retrieve and display the relevant details of that batch. This is useful for tracking and reviewing specific batch commands you have submitted or are interested in.

### 6. See Batch by User
**Functionality:** This feature enables users to search for batches by the username of the person who submitted them.
How it works: By entering a username into the search field, you can view all the batches submitted by that user. This is helpful for users who wish to review their own work or follow the activity of other contributors.
