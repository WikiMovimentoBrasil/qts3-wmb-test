# QuickStatements 3.0 Documentation

## Features

- Navigation links
    - **New batch link:** Clicking this link takes users to a page where users can add new script batches in either V1 or CSV format, provide the batch name in "batch name field" then proceed to the field and type in the commands. When done with typing commands in the text area users can click the execute button.
    - **Last batches:** This button is not yet doing anything except its default function and that is refreshing the page. So clicking it will just refresh the page.
    - **Git link:** Links to the Git repository for QuickStatements, where users can find source code, documentation, or contribute to the project.
    - **Login:** The login functionality will login the registered users to their accounts but is not yet functional.

- Buttons
    - **New Batch Button:** Do the same thing as the "New batch link", takes you to the new batch creation page.
    - **See batch details:** When the logic is added users will be able to view batch details by entering the batch ID and clicking the button.
    - **See batches by username:** When the logic is added, you can also view the batches by user by inputting the username in the input field and click the button.
